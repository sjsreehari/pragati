Functions and Duties Legislative Sabha/Parishad)\n\nAssembly/Council Name\n\n(Vidhan The Assembly/ Council Nameis the unicameral legislature of the Indian\n\nstate of State Name. The present strength of the Assembly/ Council is\n\nXXX. The Legislative Assembly/ Council represents the people of State Name. The members of Assembly/ Council are directly elected by people\n\non the basis of universal adult franchise. They are directly elected by all\n\nadult citizens registered as voters in the State. All men and women who\n\nare 18 years of age and above are eligible to be included in the voters’\n\nList. They vote to elect members of State Assembly. Members are elected\n\nfrom territorial constituencies. The State is divided into as many (single\n\nmember) constituencies as the number of members to be elected. Certain\n\nnumbers of seats are reserved (if any).\n\nIn order to become a Member of Assembly/ Council a person must:\n\n be a citizen of India;\n\n have attained the age of 25 years;\n\n his/her name must be in voters’ list;\n\n must not hold any office of profit i.e.;\n\n Should not be a government servant.\n\nThe tenure of Assembly/ Council is five years, but the Governor can\n\ndissolve it before the completion of its term on the advice of Chief Minister. It may be dissolved by the President in case of constitutional\n\nemergency proclaimed under Article 356 of the Constitution.\n\nPresiding Officer (The Speaker/Chairman)\n\nThe members of Assembly/ Council elect their Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer\n\nis known as\n\nthe Speaker/Chairman. The Speaker/Chairman presides over the meetings of the House and\n\nconducts its proceedings. He maintains order in the House, allow the Members to ask questions and speak. He puts Billsand other measures\n\nto vote and announces the result of voting. The Speaker/Chairman does National e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 7 of 44\n\n\fnot ordinarily vote at the time of voting. However, he may exercise\n\ncasting vote in case of a tie.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker/Chairman presides over the meeting during the\n\nabsence of the Speaker/Chairman. He is also elected by the Assembly\n\nfrom amongst its members.\n\nSessions of the State Legislature The State Legislature meets at least thrice a year and the interval between\n\ntwo Sessions cannot be more than six months. The Governor summons\n\nand prorogues the Sessions of State Legislature. He addresses the Assembly/ Council at the commencement of the first Session after each\n\ngeneral election and at the commencement of the first Session of the year.\n\nThis Address reflects the policy statement of the government which is to\n\nbe discussed in the Legislature.\n\nPOWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE\n\nLaw Making Function The primary function of the State Legislature is law-making. The State Legislature is empowered to make laws on State List and Concurrent List. The Parliament Assembly and the Legislative Assemblies have the\n\nright to make the laws on the subjects mentioned in the Concurrent List.\n\nBut in case of contradiction between the Union and State law on the\n\nsubject the law made by the Union shall prevail.\n\nBills are of two types-Ordinary Bills and Money Bills. The Bills are\n\nintroduced in the State Legislature. After the Bill is passed by State Legislature, it is sent to the Governor for his assent. The Governor can\n\nsend back the Bill for reconsideration. When this Bill is passed again by\n\nthe Legislature, the Governor has to give his assent.\n\nNational e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 8 of 44\n\n\fFinancial Powers The State Legislature keeps control over the finances of the State. A\n\nmoney Bill is introduced in the Assembly. The money Bill includes\n\nauthorization of the expenditure to be incurred by the government,\n\nimposition or abolition of taxes, borrowing, etc. The Bill is introduced by a Minister on the recommendations of the Governor. After a money Bill is\n\npassed by the Assembly, it is sent to the Governor for his assent. The Governor cannot withhold his assent, as money Bills are introduced with\n\nhis prior approval.\n\nControl over the Executive The State Legislature keeps control over the executive. The Council of Ministers is responsible to Assembly collectively and remains in the office\n\nso long as it enjoys the confidence of the Assembly. The Council is\n\nremoved if the Assembly adopts a vote of no-confidence, or when it rejects\n\na government Bill.\n\nIn addition to the no-confidence motion, the Legislature keeps checks on\n\nthe government by asking questions and supplementary questions,\n\nmoving adjournment motions and calling attention notices.\n\nElectoral Functions The elected Members of the Assembly are Members of the Electoral College for the election of the President of India. Thus, they have say in\n\nthe election of the President of the Republic. The Members of the Assembly also elect Members of the RajyaSabha from their respective States. In all these elections, Members of the Assembly cast their votes in\n\naccordance with single transferable vote system.\n\nConstitutional Functions The Constitution Amendment requires special majority of each House of\n\nthe Parliament and ratification by not less than half of the States relating\n\nto Federal subjects. The resolution for the ratification is passed by State National e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 9 of 44\n\n\fLegislatures with simple majority. However, a constitutional amendment\n\ncannot be initiated in the State Legislature.\n\nLegislature Secretariat The Legislative Assembly/ Council Secretariat, besides providing Secretarial assistance in legislative functioning of the Hon’ble Speaker/\n\nChairman, caters to the multifarious requirements of the Members of Legislative Assembly/ Council with a view to rendering them timely\n\nassistance in the discharge of their functions. The Legislative Secretariat\n\nalso takes care of the welfare of the Members and Ex-Members. Some of\n\nthe important functions are as under:-\n\ni) To control the Executive through Questions, Motions,\n\nResolutions, Committees etc.\n\nii) To control the finances through general discussions on Budget, device of token cut on demands and discussions on Finance Bills and Appropriation Bills and\n\niii) To enact Legislations.\n\nCOMMITTEE SYSTEM\n\nThe enormous range and magnitude of the government activities in the\n\npresent day State has led State Legislature to shift emphasis from\n\nlawmaking activities to supervision/control of the administration. This is\n\nnot limited only to the voting of moneys by the State Legislature but also\n\nextends to ensure that expenditure is incurred in a prudent & specified\n\nmanner on plans and programmes approved by the Legislature and that\n\nthe objectives underlying these programmes are achieved. State Legislature as a body, however, is not in a position to undertake this\n\nstupendous task on its own nor it is practically possible. As a matter of\n\nfact, it cannot use the floor time for minute details nor it has enough\n\ntime for doing so. Therefore, to make Assembly/ Council surveillance\n\neffective and more meaningful, a suitable machinery is required. The Committees are constituted to ensure this accountability of the Executive\n\nto the Legislature. Besides, enabling more people to become associated National e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 10 of 44\n\n\fwith the governmental processes, these also help in making use of the\n\nexperience and expertise in guiding and supervising the government's\n\nfunctioning. These Committees are, therefore, referred to as \"House in Miniature\" or \"House in Perpetuity\"\n\nAt the commencement of the first Session after each general election and\n\nthereafter before the commencement of each financial year or from time\n\nto time when the occasion otherwise arises, different Committees of the House for specific, or general purposes are nominated by the Speaker/\n\nChairman.\n\n4.PROJECT BRIEF\n\n4.1 OBJECTIVES OF THE NeVA MMP:\n\nThe objectives of the National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) MMP\n\nare to ensure the following:\n\n➢ The backend computerization of all the branches of the State Legislature Secretariats in order to ensure electronic delivery of\n\ninformation / data to the Members of the State Legislature and\n\nto interact with various State Government Departments.\n\n➢ Efficient delivery of services with improved service levels by\n\nundertaking extensive Business Process Reengineering (BPR) of\n\nidentified services and their processes.\n\n➢ Capacity building and training for the Members of the State Legislature, officials of the State Legislature Secretariat and\n\nother officials of the State Government Departments by setting\n\nup NeVA Seva Kendra (NSK), e-Learning Center in the State Legislature location.\n\n➢ Setting up of NeVA Seva Kendra (NSK) for e-Facilitation, in all\n\nthe State Legislature to assist the Members.\n\n➢ Development of generic, multitenancy National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) product for implementation in the National Data Centre Cloud (Meghraj).\n\nNational e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 11 of 44\n\n\f➢ Delivery of public services (information dissemination) through\n\nthe public portals to ensure reliability, efficiency, transparency\n\nand accountability of the Members of the State Legislature and\n\nother State Government functionaries.\n\n➢ Reducing the number of visits of citizen to their elected\n\nrepresentatives in order to get their grievances redressal.\n\n➢ To provide e-interaction and efficient communication between\n\nthe citizen and their public representative.\n\n➢ To enhance the perception and the image of the Members of the State Legislature and the officials of the State Government.\n\n4.2 SCOPE OF THEPROJECT\n\n➢ The National e-Vidhan Application MMP envisages centralized\n\narchitecture at the National level with common application\n\nsoftware for each of the identified services for all the State Legislatures.

OVERVIEW OF THE ONLINE SYSTEM\n6.1. OBJECTIVES OF THE SYSTEM\n\nThe objective of the proposed application “e-Vidhan” is to automate the\nprocesses of LegislativeAssembly/ Council, Committees & Members to\nachieve the followinggoals:\n\n• To identify and suggest an appropriate process re-engineering model\n\n• To\n\nidentify systems enabled mechanism\n\nthat\n\nreduces and\n\nsubstantially removes redundant processes which otherwise delay\n\nflow of information among various stakeholders.\n\n• To identify and suggest an appropriate technology model that is both\n\nuser friendly and which withstands the tough field conditions\n\n•\n\nInduction of transparency and accountability in operations\n\n• Electronic security and control of confidential data\n\n• Dissemination of information as per requirement\n\n• MIS for easy monitoring and quick decision making\n\n• To improve efficiency in working\n\n• To improve decision making in view of better reporting mechanisms National e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 30 of 44\n\n\f• To help carry various analytical studies by providing the data\n\ninstantaneously\n\n• Significant reduction in manual records/register maintenance\n\n• Elimination of duplicate and inconsistent record keeping\n\n• To reduce the dependency\n\n• To Support the organization in meeting its business and legal\n\nrequirements\n\n• To ensure better implementation of Schemes\n\n• To Provides cost effective service and quality of the same\n\n• To provide a friendly, speedier and efficient interface\n\n• To use less paper to save trees and implement green practices\n\n(Go Green)\n\nNational e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 31 of 44\n\n\f6.2. SHORT COMINGS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM\n\n• Redundant processes\n\n• Classical disconnect\n\n• Difficulty in monitoring – mainly implementation of schemes by the Government\n\n• Dependency\n\n• Complexity\n\n• Delay\n\n• Lack of Transparency\n\n• Lack of Accountability\n\n• Unnecessary Excess Paper Work and huge paper wastage\n\n• Difficulty in maintaining upto date Records\n\n• Repetitive efforts\n\n• Wastage of Time, Money and Efforts\n\n• Lack of information\n\n• Lack of standardization and uniformity of the working methodology\n\n6.3. STAKEHOLDERS/AUTOMATION OF PROCESSES\n\n• Questions processing and answering by departments\n\n• Assembly Business and proceedings\n\n•\n\nInternal working of the Assembly/ CouncilCommittees & reply by\n\ndepartments\n\n• Working of branches of the Assembly/ CouncilSecretariat\n\n• Constituency management by MLAs/ MLCs\n\n• Communication between the Assembly/ CouncilSecretariat and Government Departments\n\n• Public Participation – Public Opinion on Bills, Constituency-wise Demands etc.\n\n6.4.

The resistant to change phenomenon can explain\n\nmuch of the hesitation that occurs on the part of constituents in\n\nmoving from a paper based to a Web-based system for interacting\n\nwith government processes. Stakeholders can all have their biases\n\nwith respect to how transactions should be processed.\n\nDigital Divide –\n\nThe digital divide refers to the separation that exists between\n\nindividuals and communities that have got used to information\n\ntechnology and those that do not have such access/knowledge. As the\n\ndigital divide narrows, broader adoption of e-government becomes\n\npossible.\n\n• Attitudinal change in members, officers and employees\n\n• Government process re-engineering\n\n•\n\n•\n\nInformation transparency Infrastructure, Skill and awareness\n\n• Access to right information\n\n•\n\nInterdepartmental collaboration\n\n6.5.

BACKGROUND OF PROJECT\n\n2.1 Background of Project National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) is one of the 44 Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) under the Digital India Programme (DIP) under the State category. The Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs (MoPA), Government\n\nof India is the Nodal Department for National e-Vidhan Application\n\n(NeVA) MMP.National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) is to be implemented\n\nin all the States/UTs Legislativelocations.\n\nThe Aim/Objective of National e-Vidhan Application\n\nis\n\nelectronic flow of information, electronic laying of documents on the Table of the House and electronic information exchange among all the\n\nstakeholders to create paperless legislature in the country. This will also\n\nprovide Data analytics, Information processing and comparative analysis\n\nof the data of all the State Legislatures. The electronic delivery of services\n\nto its key stakeholder i.e. the Members of the State Legislatures is the\n\none of the key mission of National e-Vidhan Application.\n\nAs per the guidelines for implementation of National e-Vidhan Application from Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, Government of India\n\npublished in March 2020, for the implementation of NeVA in the States,\n\neach House has to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) along-with Gap Analysis of Information Technology Assets and manpower\n\nrequirement.

Functions and Duties Legislative Sabha/Parishad)\n\nAssembly/Council Name\n\n(Vidhan The Assembly/ Council Nameis the unicameral legislature of the Indian\n\nstate of State Name. The present strength of the Assembly/ Council is\n\nXXX. The Legislative Assembly/ Council represents the people of State Name. The members of Assembly/ Council are directly elected by people\n\non the basis of universal adult franchise. They are directly elected by all\n\nadult citizens registered as voters in the State. All men and women who\n\nare 18 years of age and above are eligible to be included in the voters’\n\nList. They vote to elect members of State Assembly. Members are elected\n\nfrom territorial constituencies. The State is divided into as many (single\n\nmember) constituencies as the number of members to be elected. Certain\n\nnumbers of seats are reserved (if any).\n\nIn order to become a Member of Assembly/ Council a person must:\n\n be a citizen of India;\n\n have attained the age of 25 years;\n\n his/her name must be in voters’ list;\n\n must not hold any office of profit i.e.;\n\n Should not be a government servant.\n\nThe tenure of Assembly/ Council is five years, but the Governor can\n\ndissolve it before the completion of its term on the advice of Chief Minister. It may be dissolved by the President in case of constitutional\n\nemergency proclaimed under Article 356 of the Constitution.\n\nPresiding Officer (The Speaker/Chairman)\n\nThe members of Assembly/ Council elect their Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer\n\nis known as\n\nthe Speaker/Chairman. The Speaker/Chairman presides over the meetings of the House and\n\nconducts its proceedings. He maintains order in the House, allow the Members to ask questions and speak. He puts Billsand other measures\n\nto vote and announces the result of voting. The Speaker/Chairman does National e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 7 of 44\n\n\fnot ordinarily vote at the time of voting. However, he may exercise\n\ncasting vote in case of a tie.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker/Chairman presides over the meeting during the\n\nabsence of the Speaker/Chairman. He is also elected by the Assembly\n\nfrom amongst its members.\n\nSessions of the State Legislature The State Legislature meets at least thrice a year and the interval between\n\ntwo Sessions cannot be more than six months. The Governor summons\n\nand prorogues the Sessions of State Legislature. He addresses the Assembly/ Council at the commencement of the first Session after each\n\ngeneral election and at the commencement of the first Session of the year.\n\nThis Address reflects the policy statement of the government which is to\n\nbe discussed in the Legislature.\n\nPOWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE\n\nLaw Making Function The primary function of the State Legislature is law-making. The State Legislature is empowered to make laws on State List and Concurrent List. The Parliament Assembly and the Legislative Assemblies have the\n\nright to make the laws on the subjects mentioned in the Concurrent List.\n\nBut in case of contradiction between the Union and State law on the\n\nsubject the law made by the Union shall prevail.\n\nBills are of two types-Ordinary Bills and Money Bills. The Bills are\n\nintroduced in the State Legislature. After the Bill is passed by State Legislature, it is sent to the Governor for his assent. The Governor can\n\nsend back the Bill for reconsideration. When this Bill is passed again by\n\nthe Legislature, the Governor has to give his assent.\n\nNational e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 8 of 44\n\n\fFinancial Powers The State Legislature keeps control over the finances of the State. A\n\nmoney Bill is introduced in the Assembly. The money Bill includes\n\nauthorization of the expenditure to be incurred by the government,\n\nimposition or abolition of taxes, borrowing, etc. The Bill is introduced by a Minister on the recommendations of the Governor. After a money Bill is\n\npassed by the Assembly, it is sent to the Governor for his assent. The Governor cannot withhold his assent, as money Bills are introduced with\n\nhis prior approval.\n\nControl over the Executive The State Legislature keeps control over the executive. The Council of Ministers is responsible to Assembly collectively and remains in the office\n\nso long as it enjoys the confidence of the Assembly. The Council is\n\nremoved if the Assembly adopts a vote of no-confidence, or when it rejects\n\na government Bill.\n\nIn addition to the no-confidence motion, the Legislature keeps checks on\n\nthe government by asking questions and supplementary questions,\n\nmoving adjournment motions and calling attention notices.\n\nElectoral Functions The elected Members of the Assembly are Members of the Electoral College for the election of the President of India. Thus, they have say in\n\nthe election of the President of the Republic. The Members of the Assembly also elect Members of the RajyaSabha from their respective States. In all these elections, Members of the Assembly cast their votes in\n\naccordance with single transferable vote system.\n\nConstitutional Functions The Constitution Amendment requires special majority of each House of\n\nthe Parliament and ratification by not less than half of the States relating\n\nto Federal subjects. The resolution for the ratification is passed by State National e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 9 of 44\n\n\fLegislatures with simple majority. However, a constitutional amendment\n\ncannot be initiated in the State Legislature.\n\nLegislature Secretariat The Legislative Assembly/ Council Secretariat, besides providing Secretarial assistance in legislative functioning of the Hon’ble Speaker/\n\nChairman, caters to the multifarious requirements of the Members of Legislative Assembly/ Council with a view to rendering them timely\n\nassistance in the discharge of their functions. The Legislative Secretariat\n\nalso takes care of the welfare of the Members and Ex-Members. Some of\n\nthe important functions are as under:-\n\ni) To control the Executive through Questions, Motions,\n\nResolutions, Committees etc.\n\nii) To control the finances through general discussions on Budget, device of token cut on demands and discussions on Finance Bills and Appropriation Bills and\n\niii) To enact Legislations.\n\nCOMMITTEE SYSTEM\n\nThe enormous range and magnitude of the government activities in the\n\npresent day State has led State Legislature to shift emphasis from\n\nlawmaking activities to supervision/control of the administration. This is\n\nnot limited only to the voting of moneys by the State Legislature but also\n\nextends to ensure that expenditure is incurred in a prudent & specified\n\nmanner on plans and programmes approved by the Legislature and that\n\nthe objectives underlying these programmes are achieved. State Legislature as a body, however, is not in a position to undertake this\n\nstupendous task on its own nor it is practically possible. As a matter of\n\nfact, it cannot use the floor time for minute details nor it has enough\n\ntime for doing so. Therefore, to make Assembly/ Council surveillance\n\neffective and more meaningful, a suitable machinery is required. The Committees are constituted to ensure this accountability of the Executive\n\nto the Legislature. Besides, enabling more people to become associated National e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 10 of 44\n\n\fwith the governmental processes, these also help in making use of the\n\nexperience and expertise in guiding and supervising the government's\n\nfunctioning. These Committees are, therefore, referred to as \"House in Miniature\" or \"House in Perpetuity\"\n\nAt the commencement of the first Session after each general election and\n\nthereafter before the commencement of each financial year or from time\n\nto time when the occasion otherwise arises, different Committees of the House for specific, or general purposes are nominated by the Speaker/\n\nChairman.\n\n4.PROJECT BRIEF\n\n4.1 OBJECTIVES OF THE NeVA MMP:\n\nThe objectives of the National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) MMP\n\nare to ensure the following:\n\n➢ The backend computerization of all the branches of the State Legislature Secretariats in order to ensure electronic delivery of\n\ninformation / data to the Members of the State Legislature and\n\nto interact with various State Government Departments.\n\n➢ Efficient delivery of services with improved service levels by\n\nundertaking extensive Business Process Reengineering (BPR) of\n\nidentified services and their processes.\n\n➢ Capacity building and training for the Members of the State Legislature, officials of the State Legislature Secretariat and\n\nother officials of the State Government Departments by setting\n\nup NeVA Seva Kendra (NSK), e-Learning Center in the State Legislature location.\n\n➢ Setting up of NeVA Seva Kendra (NSK) for e-Facilitation, in all\n\nthe State Legislature to assist the Members.\n\n➢ Development of generic, multitenancy National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) product for implementation in the National Data Centre Cloud (Meghraj).\n\nNational e-Vidhan Application DPR- Assembly/Council Name Page 11 of 44\n\n\f➢ Delivery of public services (information dissemination) through\n\nthe public portals to ensure reliability, efficiency, transparency\n\nand accountability of the Members of the State Legislature and\n\nother State Government functionaries.\n\n➢ Reducing the number of visits of citizen to their elected\n\nrepresentatives in order to get their grievances redressal.\n\n➢ To provide e-interaction and efficient communication between\n\nthe citizen and their public representative.\n\n➢ To enhance the perception and the image of the Members of the State Legislature and the officials of the State Government.\n\n4.2 SCOPE OF THEPROJECT\n\n➢ The National e-Vidhan Application MMP envisages centralized\n\narchitecture at the National level with common application\n\nsoftware for each of the identified services for all the State Legislatures.

SHORT COMINGS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM\n\n• Redundant processes\n\n• Classical disconnect\n\n• Difficulty in monitoring – mainly implementation of schemes by the Government\n\n• Dependency\n\n• Complexity\n\n• Delay\n\n• Lack of Transparency\n\n• Lack of Accountability\n\n• Unnecessary Excess Paper Work and huge paper wastage\n\n• Difficulty in maintaining upto date Records\n\n• Repetitive efforts\n\n• Wastage of Time, Money and Efforts\n\n• Lack of information\n\n• Lack of standardization and uniformity of the working methodology\n\n6.3. STAKEHOLDERS/AUTOMATION OF PROCESSES\n\n• Questions processing and answering by departments\n\n• Assembly Business and proceedings\n\n•\n\nInternal working of the Assembly/ CouncilCommittees & reply by\n\ndepartments\n\n• Working of branches of the Assembly/ CouncilSecretariat\n\n• Constituency management by MLAs/ MLCs\n\n• Communication between the Assembly/ CouncilSecretariat and Government Departments\n\n• Public Participation – Public Opinion on Bills, Constituency-wise Demands etc.\n\n6.4.
